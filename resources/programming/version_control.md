# 1️⃣ Version Control 

### 🌴 Git
Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes to their code over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other’s work. Key features include branching (to create separate lines of development), merging (to combine changes), and a history log (to see all past versions). It’s essential for managing projects efficiently and ensuring code integrity.
